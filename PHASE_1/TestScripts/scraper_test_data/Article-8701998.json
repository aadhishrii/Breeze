The ministry has said that most of the children have lost lives in the Afghan capital Kabul, Helmand, and Kunduz provinces while most cases of measles have been recorded in Jawzjan, Ghor, and Kunduz provinces.\r\n\r\nIt comes as the Ministry has launched a 6-day vaccination drive in provinces with most cases of measles.\r\n\r\nUnhealthy and insufficient food for children [makes them more susceptible to measles].
