The ministry has said that most of the children have lost lives in the Afghan capital Kabul, Helmand, and Kunduz provinces while most cases of measles have been recorded in Jawzjan, Ghor, and Kunduz provinces.It comes as the Ministry has launched a 6day vaccination drive in provinces with most cases of measles.Unhealthy and insufficient food for children [makes them more susceptible to measles]. The thing that is not rare in a country where 97 percent of people are living under the poverty line.[Byline: Najibullah Lalzoy]Communicated by:ProMED Rapporteur Mahmoud Orabi[\"The low routine measles immunization coverage of 66% [in Afghanistan] and longer interval since the measles followup campaign in 2018 have resulted in the accumulation of the high number of children under 5 years old with no measles immunization, said WHO.\"\"The rise in measles cases in Afghanistan is especially concerning because of the extremely high levels of malnutrition. [Malnutrition contributes to weakening immunity, making people more vulnerable to illness and death from diseases like measles  especially children],\" WHO Representative in Afghanistan Dr Luo Dapeng said.\"The health emergency comes as officials at the United Nations say decades of conflict, a devastating drought, a collapsing economy and the impact of international sanctions on Taliban rulers are causing \"irreparable damage\" to Afghan children.\"The UN estimates that around 23 million people, more than half of Afghanistan's population, need humanitarian assistance. It says one in 3 people faces acute hunger and 2 million children are malnourished.\" (https://www.voanews.com/a/measlesoutbreakkills142childreninafghanistan/6484362.html; 14 Mar 2022).
